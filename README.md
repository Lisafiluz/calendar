### Project's objectives
1. Develop open source calendar tool using new technics while trying new things.
2. Using Python as main programming language and plain HTML/JS for GUI.
3. Create bonding in our community.

## Creating development environment
### Prerequisites
1. Windows or Linux based system - either [WSL on windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or full blown linux.
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) 

### Running on Windows

```shell
virtualenv env
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Copy app\config.py.example to app\config.py.
# Edit the variables' values.
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Running on Linux
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp app/config.py.example app/configuration.py
# Edit the variables' values.
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#Cypress:
Front end testing tool.

Every test created with testLevel configuration, the defualt level we run our test is 5.
Basic tests will spicified with lower testLevel than advanced tests.

#To run Cypress:

1. Make sure you already installed npm (run npm --version to check).
2. Run the server
3. Nevigate to 'test-ui' folder: calendar/tests/test-ui
    - Run with Test Runner:
        1. Run on terminal: ```npx cypress open```
        2. Test Runner will open: choose test and click it to execute
    - Run all test without watching:
        1. Run on terminal: ```npx cypress run```
    - Run a specific test file without watching:
        1. Run on terminal: ```npx cypress run --spec cypress/integration/path/to/file```
    - Run tests with change level env config to 10: ```npx cypress run --env level=10```
